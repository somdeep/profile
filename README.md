<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>

**MICROSOFT** | Software Engineer 2 | Bing Knowledge Graph and Desktop Tabs

Feb 2020 – Present | Seattle, WA

- Helped drive Tabs on Desktop for Bing as a unique Search Engine feature by building end-to-end, scalable data pipeline using Cosmos, Spark, C# and .NET to ship Tabs to 80 languages and markets, bringing in 40 million impressions, over 20 million DAU and 2 million new clicks daily.
- Led three-person effort to attain coverage improvements of 20% via harnessing Bing Knowledge Graph and designing Signature-based query recognition to shift away from static pattern-based triggering. Constructed data pipeline using Azure Batch scheduling and grew key metrics likeuser tab interaction stability from 60% to 99.993%. Developed distributed microservices-based metrics architecture to generate business insights periodically at scale on Power BI and Azure Synapse Analytics,that helps identify and drive new feature areas across the team and capture issues.
- Oversaw four-person effort dovetailing with multiple teams to fully migrate DesktopTabs to utilizing more efficient column-store based Knowledge Graph V2-from designing microservices-based architecture to final data pipeline and drove this to completion backed by in-depth metrics, richer data sources and language globalisation.
- Leveraged Bing Index to crawl IPEDSand USNews sources and built end-to-end scalable, periodically-refreshed data extraction pipeline provisioned on Azure SQLServer and MongoDB on Azure Cosmos DB to generate Programs, Cost, Admissions and Rankings experiences for Global Universities on Bing.com, Mobile and Edge Chromium.

**MICROSOFT** | Software Engineer | Bing Knowledge Graph Data Platform

Feb 2017 – Feb 2020 | Seattle, WA

- Improved batch and streaming pipeline processing over 10 petabytes of data each day, serving Bing,Office and Edge, using Cosmos, Spark, Hadoop, Java, C# and .NET hosted on Azure Data Lake,by achieving reduction in downstream XMLpayload size by 80% and dropping turnaround time by 50% to under 24 hours via intelligent understanding of user interest on Bing.com and constructing algorithms to identify, rank facts by importance using custom models and construct graph payloads using Depth First traversal at scale.
- Spearheaded Verified Facts effort to identify and persist static facts in high-availability, low-latency column store with fully orchestrated microservices focused on identifying and taking away daily unwanted churn of over 500 million facts / 20% of daily incremental load. Incorporated a service that automated data quality via statistical analysis to build ’churn timeline’ concept and periodically pushed ratified data to a distributed, in-memory, graph processing engine.
- Shifted metrics framework at data ingestion and crawling level to event-driven, dynamically-scaling approach using Kusto and Azure Data Explorer for enriched dashboards. Added E2E integration testing and shipped platform maintenance, versioning snapshots and rollback mechanisms to maintain quality of releases viaAzure DevOps and to reduce manual livesite interventions by developers on Bing.com.
